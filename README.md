This repository provides PyTorch implementations for training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from scratch and fine-tuning pre-trained models.

The project is structured into two main sections: **Part A** and **Part B**.

## Part A – Training a Custom CNN

Part A focuses on designing and training a CNN from scratch using the iNaturalist dataset. A `train.py` script is provided, which supports various command-line arguments to configure the training process as needed.

## Part B – Fine-Tuning ResNet50

Part B involves fine-tuning **ResNet50**, a widely-used pre-trained CNN, on the iNaturalist dataset. Like Part A, it includes a `train.py` script that can be customized via command-line options.

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the README files inside each subdirectory.
